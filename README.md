# Wage by County Visualization
This program takes in a file of employment information about individuals employed in Child Care Centers across the state of Montana. The mean wage per county is displayed as a bar graph.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a python data visualization project for Montana State University in Summer 2018, and was used to help inform the Early Childhood Project about workforce wages in Montana counties.
